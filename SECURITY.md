## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have found a security vulnerability, please do NOT use GitHub Issues to notify me of it.

Instead, please email me at redstonedesigner1@gmail.com and clearly state the following:

* The repository name (bit-adder)
* That you are reporting a security vulnerability
* The steps you took that led you to discover this security vulnerability
* The requisite CVE number, if available

I will respond to your email in no more than **28** days, and either request more information or reach a decision on whether to accept or reject the vulnerability.

If your vulnerability is rejected, please create a GitHub Issue with the same information you provided in the email.
